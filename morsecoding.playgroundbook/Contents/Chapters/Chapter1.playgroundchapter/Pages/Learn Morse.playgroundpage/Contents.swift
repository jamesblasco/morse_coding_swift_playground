**Challenge**: Code our first morse message
 
In the side view you are able to navigate through the different letters and learn which code signals are associated with them. Now let's try to create our own message
 
## SOS: The best known morse signal
 
The use of **SOS** was introduced at the beginning of the 20th century and it's the standard signal used in case of emergency.
 
Let's try to learn how it is written in morse.
 
 1. Check the needed letters in the side view
 
 2. Write inside the quotation marks using dots **.** and dashes **-**
 
 3. Run the code
